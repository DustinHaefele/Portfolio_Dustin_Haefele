    <h2 class="section-title">ABOUT ME</h2>

    <p id="about-me">Hey, I’m Dustin, an aspiring web developer currently based in Athens, Georgia.  
      I am passionate about coming up with efficient solutions to complex problems, travelling the world, 
      good puns, and the Dvorak keyboard layout. </br></br>

        In my first life, I was as a Chemical Engineer.  I graduated from the University of Nebraska with a BS in Chemical Engineering 
        and used it to make manufacturing plants more efficient for six years.  In my final two years working in manufacturing plants, 
        I found my love for programming.  </br></br>
        
        I started solving some of the problems we were having with basic PLC programming.  After that, I talked my boss into letting me 
        learn how to program our 15-foot tall material handling robot.  I wrote some new robotics programs to help the maintenance 
        department, and of course, “taught” it how to dance.  </br></br>
        
        When I saw a chance to make work more than just a paycheck I had to do something about it. I loved the programming 
        I was doing so much that I decided to make a leap and enroll in a Fullstack Development program through Thinkful.  
        I am currently finishing that program and seeking a full-time developing position to use the skills that I already have and 
        continue to learn more so that I can do my part in making the world a little better place to live in one application at a time.
